# qats by DNV GL

A python library for time series processing and visualization, including spectral analysis and statistical processing.

Originally written to work with time series files exported from [SIMO](https://www.dnvgl.com/services/complex-multibody-calculations-simo-2311) and [RIFLEX](https://www.dnvgl.com/services/riser-analysis-software-for-marine-riser-systems-riflex-2312), and was later expanded to support hdf5 (.h5) files exported from [SIMA](https://www.dnvgl.com/services/marine-operations-and-mooring-analysis-software-sima-2324). Now supports a growing number of file formats. 

## Features

Python library: 
- Load and export from/to various pre-defined time series file formats.
- Time series processing, incl. filtering, spectral analysis and maxima (peak) detection.
- Extreme values statistics using Weibull and Gumbel distributions.
- Rain-flow counting.

GUI:
- Quick and easy access to time series inspection and comparison.
- Spectral analysis and time series filtering.
- Quick fit of maxima distribution (Weibull).
- Drag-and-drop to load time series files.
